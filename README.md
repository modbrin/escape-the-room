ESCAPE THE ROOM

Game written in Haskell in a scope of CodeWorld Framework.

### Prerequisites

This project relies on the [Haskell Stack tool](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).

It is recommended to get Stack with batteries included by
installing [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).

## Build

To build this project simply run

```
stack build
```

This will install all dependencies, including a proper version of GHC
(which should be there already if you have Haskell Platform 8.4.3).

## Run

This project has one executable that you can run with

```
stack exec escape-the-room-exe
```

Then you can follow the link it will produce.
Game is played in browser.
